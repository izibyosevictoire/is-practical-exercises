## 1.Counting Zeros
Count Total number of zeros from 1 up to n?
Explanation: So the trick here is. if you have a number 1 to 50 the value is 5. just 50 divided by 10. However, if the value is 100. The value is 11. you will get by 100/10 = 10 and 10/10. That's how you will get in the more zeros in one number like (100, 200, 1000)
